## Welcome!

This repository contains projects that I have modified to improve and show off my skills in Excel. Before modifications are made, these project files come with basic formatting. Under each project I mention what I have changed in each file. The original project files came from the course [Microsoft Excel - Excel from Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/microsoft-excel-2013-from-beginner-to-advanced-and-beyond/) and was made by Kyle Pew.

## Excel Files:
Instead of committing Excel workbooks, I am going to share the projects I have via Google Drive.

### Project 1:
This is my first project completed ever in Excel. While it does not contain a lot of data, purpose of this project was to use Visual Basic for Applications to activate a macro that users can click on and activate. You can download the file by clicking <i>[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=128ECOWX6KQE6dX5HNtkwAePb2U3sGp5Yi)</i>.

Here is a few details about the modified document:
* Uses a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) module for the following purposes:
 * Provide a GUI that the user can enter how they want to sort the records in the spreadsheet
 * Sorts the spreadsheet by division (east, north, west, and south)
 * Sorts the spreadsheet by category (advertisng, rent, maintence, etc.)
 * Sorts the spreadsheet by the total price made from previous months
* Has a button to easily use our macro
* Explains how to access the code for those who do not already know how to access VBA within Excel

### Project 2:
The purpose of this project was to create a macro using VBA to create headers in the first row across all current and future worksheets in this workbook. You can download the file by clicking <i>[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EXn3-N_orztbkdDILYRqZ6jptOyAvgQQ)</i>.

Here is a few details about the modified document:
* Uses a VBA module for the following purposes:
 * Adds a new line and text above the data in a worksheet
 * Adds formating to the header
 * Allows us to add a header across all and future worksheets in the workbook
* Uses a button to easily use our macro
* Explains how to access the code for those who do not already know how to access VBA within Excel
