## Welcome!

This repository contains projects that I have modified to improve and show off my skills in Excel. Before modifications are made, these project files come with basic formating. Under each project I mention what I have changed in each file. The original project files came from the course [Microsoft Excel - Excel from Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/microsoft-excel-2013-from-beginner-to-advanced-and-beyond/") and was made by Kyle Pew.

## Excel Files:
Instead of committing Excel workbooks, I am going to share the projects I have via Google Drive.

### Project 1:
This is my first project completed ever in Excel. While it does not contain a lot of data, purpose of this project was to use Visual Basic for Applications to activate a macro that users can click on and activate. You can download the file by clicking <i>[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/128ECOWX6KQE6dX5HNtkwAePb2U3sGp5Y/view?usp=sharing)</i>.

Here is a few details about the modified document:
* Uses a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) module for the following purposes:
  * Provide a GUI that the user can enter how they want to sort the records in the spreadsheet
  * Sorts the spreadsheet by division (east, north, west, and south)
  * Sorts the spreadsheet by category (advertisng, rent, maintence, etc.)
  * Sorts the spreadsheet by the total price made from previous months
* Has a button to access the main macro easily
* Explains how to access the code for those who do not know how to access VBA within Excel
